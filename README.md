[Generates TDM assessment:]

TDM CANDIDATE ASSESSMENT:
✅ Narrow therapeutic index: YES
✅ High pharmacokinetic variability: YES
✅ Difficult to monitor target: YES
✅ Known therapeutic effects: YES
✅ Serious consequences: YES

RECOMMENDATION: TDM REQUIRED
- Monitoring: INR levels
- Frequency: Weekly initially, then monthly
- Target: INR 2.0-3.0

```

### **Example 3: Drug Interaction Screening**

```
Human: "Screen interactions for patient on warfarin, metformin, and aspirin"

AI: Using screen_interactions...
[Generates comprehensive interaction analysis:]

INTERACTION SCREENING RESULTS:
🔴 MAJOR INTERACTION: Warfarin + Aspirin
- Risk: Increased bleeding
- Management: Monitor INR closely
- Alternative: Consider clopidogrel

🟡 MODERATE INTERACTION: Metformin + Aspirin
- Risk: Increased hypoglycemia risk
- Management: Monitor blood glucose
- Clinical significance: Moderate

```

### **Example 4: SOAP Documentation**

```
Human: "Document SOAP note for chest pain patient"

AI: Using document_subjective...
[Generates structured SOAP documentation:]

SUBJECTIVE:
Chief Complaint: "Chest pain for 2 hours"
History: OPQRST assessment completed
Review of Systems: Cardiovascular symptoms noted

OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs: BP 140/90, HR 88, RR 18
Physical Exam: Heart sounds regular, no murmurs
